tag: open-source-economic-computing-intro


Language versions:
------------------

- R: https://www.r-project.org/

- Python: https://www.python.org/ + http://www.scipy.org/. 
  Suggested build: Scientific Anaconda Python https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

- Julia: http://julialang.org/

Table:
- has roots in... 
- 

Notes: 
- all are interpreted languages
- may have different IDEs for ease of use
- can still use even Notepad.exe to edit code 
- have package installers
- IPython


Suggested topics:
-----------------

```
1. What is this software for?

   Types of end-user tasks solved using this software.   

2. Getting started: Installation 

   What needs to de done before you can get (a) 1+1=2, (b) print("Hello, world!")

3. Basic operations in R, Python and Julia

   Data structures
   Mathematic operations 
   Flow control operators
   Functions
   Modules
   
4. Data import and plotting

   4.1. Data import  

   4.2. Plotting

5. Econometric examples

   We do basic case of econometric estimation both as own simple code and 
   also by calling a specialized library. Own code is for understanding the 
   procedure.

   - Ordinary least squares 

   - Maximum likelihood

6. Conclusion: which is software is best?

   Depends of type of task you are solving 
   Expression/readability of code 
   Skillset and background
   Job market popularity 

   Modern teaching in econometrics = intuition + math formulas + code

Questions
---------

1. Maybe add gretl? Octave? Probably as an appendix, not to be endorsed for learning 
   instead of R/python. Can provide code for excercises, though.
